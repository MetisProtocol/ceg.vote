Voting rule change was proposed and resolved in the forum post: [Governance Team Update: Transitioning from Simple Quorum to Optimistic Quorum](https://forum.ceg.vote/t/governance-team-update-transitioning-from-simple-quorum-to-optimistic-quorum/3910) and announced on the [Metis Governance X](https://x.com/MetisGovernance/status/1899964963688423629) on March 12, 2025.

If an Optimisic Quorum does not pass (5000+ Metis is voted against), the proposal can be adjusted and resubmitted for a revote. This proposal must achieve a Quorum of at least 5000 Metis and 400 participating wallets with a 80% approval rate to pass.
