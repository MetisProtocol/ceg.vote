import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

## Core Principles

- **Tech Utility**: The project can have a token, but a general rule of thumb is that you do not need to own/buy the token to use the platform.
- **Uniqueness**: The project will bring something new and different to our network, rather than being, say, just the 29th DEX to launch on Metis. Include at least 1 unique utility that differs from other projects on the network.
