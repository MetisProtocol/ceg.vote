The voting period is 72 hours and is published on [Metis Snapshot](https://proposals.ceg.vote). During this 72-hour period, the project must meet the required quorum. Projects that pass the vote (80% YES, with a quorum of 5k METIS and 400 wallet addresses met) will be granted Community Verified Project status.
