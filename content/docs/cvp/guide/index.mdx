The CVP Branch exists to provide a pathway to projects looking to be verified and elected by the community. Verification/approval of Projects will be executed on Metisâ€™ open forum ceg.vote, followed by a community voting on Snapshot. Projects that pass the vote (80% YES and quorum of 10k METIS and 500 wallet addresses met) will be granted Community Verified Project status.

The subsequent pages illustrate a step-by-step tutorial on the entire activities of the CVP program, that is the role of the community and what it takes for a project to become a Community Verified Project.
