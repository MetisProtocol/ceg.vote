The CVP Branch exists to provide a pathway to projects looking to be verified and elected by the community. Verification/approval of Projects will be executed on Metisâ€™ open forum ceg.vote, followed by a community voting on [Snapshot](https://proposals.ceg.vote/). Under the new Optimistic Quorum model, a proposal is rejected only if AGAINST votes exceed the quorum (5,000 METIS). Otherwise, it is accepted. This means that proposals will be approved by default unless the community actively votes against them with a strong enough consensus. The 5-day vote period gives the community time to review, conduct research, and identify any potential risks or red flags.

Projects that pass the vote will be granted Community Verified Project status.

The subsequent pages illustrate a step-by-step tutorial on the entire activities of the CVP program, that is the role of the community and what it takes for a project to become a Community Verified Project.
