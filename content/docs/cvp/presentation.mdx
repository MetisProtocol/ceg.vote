title: Community Presentation
---

Once the proposal is submitted, Metis team announce when Snapshot Voting starts and encourage community to research and educate themselves by checking proposals and engaging in forum discussions. Together with Metis Advocates, Builders should present their project to the community and, conduct a Q&A (Twitter Spaces, Telegram/Discord AMA) with Metis Advocastes before/during the Snapshot Vote.

We encourage every project to maintain active communication with our community to help them understand the project mechanisms, team values, goals, and build trust.
