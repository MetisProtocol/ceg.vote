title: Community Presentation

Once the proposal is submitted, the Metis Team will announce when the Snapshot Voting starts and encourage community to research and educate themselves by checking proposals and engaging in forum discussions. Together with Metis Advocates, Builders should present their project to the community and, conduct a Q&A (Twitter Spaces, Telegram/Discord AMA) with Metis Advocates before/during the Snapshot Vote.

We encourage every project to maintain active communication with our community to help them understand the project mechanisms, team values, goals, and build trust.
