The main priority of Metis is to build a prosperous ecosystem, with many outstanding projects being brought on board the last few months since the launch of our network. Due to our commitment to decentralization and fierce and passionate community, weâ€™ve decided to hand over the important act of approving project partnerships to the community by introducing the Community Verified Projects (CVP) branch of the CEG.

For projects, this milestone marks an opportunity to engage with our community, educate, and build relationships from the beginning. To prepare for voting, Metis is encouraging the community to interact with projects to learn more about their protocols and values. Project builders can participate in the CVP to increase social media engagement, community discussion, and demonstrate their value.

Any project that passes the community review will be granted the title of: Community Verified Project.

The process of the program is outlined in the flowchart below:
